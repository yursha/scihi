He managed to capture three wild bats in Scandiono, and performed similar experiment, on which he wrote (on 20 August 1793):</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Having seen this, the candle was taken away, and for my eyes like for those of my brother and cousins we were in complete darkness. Yet the animals continued to fly around as before and never struck against obstacles, nor did they fall down, as would have happened with a night-bird. Thus a place which we believe to be completely dark is not at all so, because bats certainly could not see without light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A few days later he took two bats and covered their eyes with opaque disc made of birdlime. To his astonishment, both bats flew completely normally. He went further by surgically removing the eyeballs of one bat, which he observed as:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[The bat] flew quickly, following the different subterranean pathways from one end to the other with the speed and sureness of an uninjured bat. More than once the animal landed on the walls and at the roof of the sotterranei and finally it landed in a hole in the ceiling two inches wide, hiding itself there immediately. My astonishment at this bat which absolutely could see although deprived of its eyes is inexpressible.[13]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He concluded that bats do not need vision for navigation; although he failed to find the reason. At the time other scientists were sceptical and ridiculed his findings.[9] A contemporary of Spallanzani, the Swiss physician and naturalist Louis Jurine, learned of Spallanzani&#39;s experiments, investigated the possible mechanism of bat navigation. He discovered that bat flight was disoriented when their ears were plugged.[14] But Spallanzani did not believe that it was about hearing since bats flew very silently. He repeated his experiments by using improved ear plugs using turpentine, wax, pomatum or tinder mixed with water, to find that blinded bats could not navigate without hearing.[15] He was still suspicious that deafness alone was the cause of disoriented flight and that hearing was vital that he conducted some rather painful experiments such as burning and removing the external ear, and piercing through the inner ear. After these operations, he became convinced that hearing was fundamental to normal bat flight, upon which he noted:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This experiment, which is so decisively in favor of hearing ... has been repeated by me with equal results both in blinded bats and in seeing one.[13]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By then he was too convinced that he suggested the ear was an organ of navigation, writing:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The experiments of M. Professor Jurine, confirming by many examples those which I have done, and varied in many ways, establish without doubt the influence of the ear in the flight of blinded bats. Can it then still be said that ... [for bats] their ears rather than their eyes serve to direct them in flight?[15]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The exact scientific principle was discovered only in 1938 by two American biologists Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos.[16][17]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.d9gage6bj49e"><span class="c3">1794</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.96zk7de03h8"><span class="c7">The law of definite proportions (law of constant composition)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Proust disproved Berthollet with the law of definite proportions, which is sometimes also known as Proust&#39;s Law. Proust studied copper carbonate, the two tin oxides, and the two iron sulfides to prove this law. He did this by making artificial copper carbonate and comparing it to natural copper carbonate. With this he showed that each had the same proportion of weights between the three elements involved (Cu, C, O). Between the two types of the other compounds, Proust showed that no intermediate compounds exist between them. Proust published this paper in 1794, but the law was not accepted until 1812, when the Swedish chemist J&ouml;ns Jacob Berzelius gave him credit for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6 c12" id="h.vmwtkgu4uqvp"><span class="c3"></span></h1><h1 class="c6" id="h.o48xo0o14x0w"><span class="c3">1796</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.43pyoid6nxp2"><span class="c7">Solar system origin (Laplace)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Laplace had proposed that the current solar system had arisen from the gradual cooling and condensation of matter over millions of years.

After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting, Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810.[8] Later that year, Appert published L&#39;Art de conserver les substances animales et v&eacute;g&eacute;tales (or The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances).

For a given mass of an ideal gas, the volume and amount (moles) of the gas are directly proportional if the temperature and pressure are constant. As an example, equal volumes of molecular hydrogen and nitrogen contain the same number of molecules when they are at the same temperature and pressure, and observe ideal gas behavior. In practice, real gases show small deviations from the ideal behavior and the law holds only approximately, but is still a useful approximation for scientists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Avogadro&#39;s Law states that the relationship between the masses of the same volume of all gases (at the same temperature and pressure) corresponds to the relationship between their respective molecular weights. Hence, the relative molecular mass of a gas can be calculated from the mass of a sample of known volume.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The hypothesis was first published by Amadeo Avogadro in 1811 and it reconciled Dalton atomic theory with the &quot;incompatible&quot; idea of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac that some gases were composite of different fundamental substances (molecules) in integer proportions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gay-Lussac also believed such a proportionality must exist, but what made Avogadro&#39;s hypothesis complete and correct was his new definition of a molecule as the smallest characteristic particle of a substance which may be a single elementary atom or a permanent union of several elementary atoms. He proposed that some gases, such as hydrogen and oxygen, consisted of diatomic molecules and a water molecule could consist of three elementary atoms, two of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Avogadro&#39;s concepts reconciled Dalton&#39;s atomic hypothesis with Gay-Lussac&#39;s law of combining volumes.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.sgt239wnt3xp"><span class="c3">1813</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.jh3v4dweb0eg"><span class="c7">Chemical symbols (Berzelius)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In 1813 Berzelius published in a British journal, Thomas Thomson&#39;s Annals of Philosophy, his system of atomic symbols as one- or two-letter abbreviations of Latin names for the elements.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.pt2hsaid6d21"><span class="c3">1815</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.666me51qa0nr"><span class="c7">Cyanogen (Gay-Lussac)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gay-Lussac synthesized cyanogen, determined its empirical formula, and named it.

The device, made of glass, consists of a series of five bulbs connected and arranged in a triangular shape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To determine the carbon in an organic compound with a kaliapparat, the substance is first burned, converting any carbon present into carbon dioxide (CO2). The vaporous products are passed through the kaliapparat, which is filled with potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The potassium hydroxide reacts with the CO2 to make potassium carbonate. The reaction, ignoring ionic dissociation, can be written as follows:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">2 KOH + CO2 &rarr; K2CO3 + H2O.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Subtracting the mass of the kaliapparat before the combustion from that found after the combustion gives the amount of CO2 absorbed. From the mass of CO2 thus found, standard stoichiometric calculations then give the mass of carbon in the original sample.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before reaching the Kaliapparat, the combustion gases were conducted through a tube of hygroscopic calcium chloride, which absorbed and retained the oxidation product of the hydrogen of the sample, namely water vapor. Next, in the Kaliapparat, carbon dioxide was absorbed in a potassium hydroxide solution in the three lower bulbs, and used to measure the weight of carbon in the sample. For any substance consisting only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the percentage of oxygen was found by subtracting the carbon and hydrogen percentages from 100%; the remainder must be the percentage of oxygen. A charcoal furnace (a sheet-steel tray in which the combustion tube was laid) was used for the combustion. Weighing carbon and hydrogen directly, rather than estimating them volumetrically, greatly increased the method&#39;s accuracy of measurement. Liebig&#39;s assistant Carl Ettling perfected glass-blowing techniques for producing the Kaliapparat, and demonstrated them to visitors. Liebig&#39;s kaliapparat simplified the technique of quantitative organic analysis and rendered it routine. Brock suggests that the availability of a superior technical apparatus was one reason why Liebig was able to attract so many students to his laboratory. His method of combustion analysis was used pharmaceutically, and certainly made possible many contributions to organic, agricultural and biological chemistry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Three bulbs located along the bottom of the triangle hold the potassium hydroxide. Violent bubbling indicates that CO2 absorption is taking place, Rocke says. By the time the combustion gas has hit the third bulb, there should be little or no bubbling, a sign that all the CO2 has been absorbed, Rocke says. &ldquo;So you can tell by eye if you&rsquo;ve done the experiment right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There are two additional bulbs on the apparatus, one on the arm upstream of the triangle&rsquo;s base and another downstream. The upstream bubble can be used to test that there are no gas leaks in the system before starting the experiment. Before combustion, researchers suck potassium hydroxide into the upstream bubble, which should remain level if the system is airtight. The downstream bulb catches potassium hydroxide overflow, to ensure the solvent doesn&rsquo;t bubble out of the device.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perfection is, of course, hard to achieve: Rocke and colleagues found that Liebig&rsquo;s device provided &ldquo;erratic results for nitrogen.&rdquo; In fact, Jackson says, Liebig was &ldquo;unable to solve the extremely difficult problem of analyzing alkaloids such as morphine or quinine (which contain nitrogen) using the kaliapparat,&rdquo; Jackson says. She discovered that &ldquo;in response to this stalemate, Liebig prompted his student August Hofmann to introduce synthesis as a method for investigating organic chemistry&mdash;a move that established the field of synthetic organic chemistry&rdquo; (Hist. Stud. Nat. Sci. 2012, DOI: 10.1525/hsns.2014.44.4.319).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yet &ldquo;the success of the kaliapparat for the analysis of relatively simple compounds introduced and propagated a new practice of chemistry in hollow glassware,&rdquo; Jackson adds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The image of a chemist, wearing a lab coat, in front of a bubbling glass apparatus goes back to the kaliapparat,&rdquo; says William Brock, an emeritus professor at England&rsquo;s University of Leicester and a Liebig biographer. &ldquo;It became a symbol, like the periodic table, for what chemists do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The most important quantitative tools of 19th century organic chemistry were the analytical balance and the Five-Bulb (F&uuml;nfkugel) Apparatus, usually called the &quot;Kaliapparat&quot; (interesting etymology), which Justus Liebig invented in 1831.

Geissler tubes had only a low vacuum, around 10&minus;3 atm (100 Pa), and the electrons in them could only travel a short distance before hitting a gas molecule. So the current of electrons moved in a slow diffusion process, constantly colliding with gas molecules, never gaining much energy. These tubes did not create beams of cathode rays, only a colorful glow discharge that filled the tube as the electrons struck the gas molecules and excited them, producing light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By the 1870s, Crookes (among other researchers) was able to evacuate his tubes to a lower pressure, 10&minus;6 to 5x10&minus;8 atm, using an improved Sprengel mercury vacuum pump invented by his coworker Charles A. Gimingham. He found that as he pumped more air out of his tubes, a dark area in the glowing gas formed next to the cathode. As the pressure got lower, the dark area, now called the Faraday dark space or Crookes dark space, spread down the tube, until the inside of the tube was totally dark. However, the glass envelope of the tube began to glow at the anode end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What was happening was that as more air was pumped out of the tube, there were fewer gas molecules to obstruct the motion of the electrons from the cathode, so they could travel a longer distance, on average, before they struck one. By the time the inside of the tube became dark, they were able to travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, without a collision. They were accelerated to a high velocity by the electric field between the electrodes, both because they did not lose energy to collisions, and also because Crookes tubes were operated at a higher voltage. By the time they reached the anode end of the tube, they were going so fast that many flew past the anode and hit the glass wall. The electrons themselves were invisible, but when they hit the glass walls of the tube they excited the atoms in the glass, making them give off light or fluoresce, usually yellow-green. Later experimenters painted the back wall of Crookes tubes with fluorescent paint, to make the beams more visible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Johann Hittorf was first to recognise in 1869 that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.hrb6oyyqbfhc"><span class="c3">1872</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.yy1nbvfh7d7o"><span class="c7">Erlangen Program (Klein)</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.vmbvjgce5amk"><span class="c7">Vaseline (Chesebrough)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Though &ldquo;Wonder Jelly&rdquo; had a nice ring to it, in 1872, Chesebrough registered the jelly as &ldquo;Vaseline,&rdquo; which is believed to be derived from a combination of the German word for water, wasser, and the Greek word for oil, oleon.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.op5r71w8y54b"><span class="c3">1873</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.e3kini7jsmw3"><span class="c7">De l&rsquo;Anorexie Hyst&eacute;rique (Las&egrave;gue)</span></h2><h1 class="c6" id="h.az6jhqdj3t23"><span class="c3">1875</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.fchbu4ob2gzt"><span class="c7">Derivation of Fresnel&rsquo;s equations from electromagnetic principles (Lorentz)</span></h2><h1 class="c6" id="h.w2dtewebtmf3"><span class="c3">1876</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.vzprebkpyvy"><span class="c7">Cathode rays (Goldstein)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In 1876, Eugen Goldstein proved that they came from the cathode, and named them cathode rays (Kathodenstrahlen).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.o5l0tuxmkkhi"><span class="c7">Telephone (copper-based)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell transmitted speech through a copper telephone wire.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.da2xw8c76xr"><span class="c3">1877</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.ux3t2l357ptc"><span class="c7">Phobos and Deimos (Hall)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>In 1877 Asaph Hall discovered the Mars moons, now called Phobos and Deimos.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.v9ybnjphwfrj"><span class="c7">&quot;La folie a deux (ou folie communiquee)&rdquo; (Las&egrave;gue)</span></h2><h1 class="c6" id="h.2ipso869sht6"><span class="c3">1878</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.78rf3fcd4g2a"><span class="c7">Incandescent electric lamp (copper wire)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thomas Alva Edison produced an incandescent electric lamp requiring electricity to be brought</span></p><p class="c2"><span>to it through a copper wire.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.4aktc0tsot3b"><span class="c3">1880</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.rw639ycns17s"><span class="c7">Piezoelectricity of crystals (brothers Curie)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In 1880 brothers Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie were working as laboratory assistants at the Faculty of Sciences of Paris.

C. Becquerel, but in the direction of the so-called hemihedral azes of several pyroelectric crystals (zinc blende, sodium chlorate, boracite, tourmaline, quartz, calamine, topaz, tartaric acid, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt). Putting a properly cut crystal plate, provided with tin-foil electrodes, under pressure, they produced a charge, measured with an electrometer, that was proportional to the applied pressure. This is the direct, or generator effect of piezoelectricity. The converse effect, which deals with the motor property of piezoelectric crystals, consists in the deformation of the crystal that is directly proportional to the applied electric field. This effect was predicted by Lippmann in 1881 and was verified experimentally in the same year by the Curies. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.j52bic1m7e38"><span class="c3">1881</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.kozzjsiwzy0b"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Der Kampf der Teile im Organismus&rdquo; (Roux)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.2a0qq3iyc9eu"><span class="c7">Terrestrial Helium (Palmieri)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.i2s8gugren9c"><span class="c7">&quot;Sur les applications de la g&eacute;om&eacute;trie non-euclidienne &agrave; la th&eacute;orie des formes quadratiques&quot; (Poincare)</span></h2><h1 class="c6" id="h.4nw2wjp5zqr5"><span class="c3">1882</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.sw9765c7s7hz"><span class="c7">Chromosome (Flemming)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>It&rsquo;s generally recognized that chromosomes were first discovered by Walther Flemming in 1882.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.tjl5mrt12qy5"><span class="c3">1883</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.c7emooazhisf"><span class="c7">Germplasm (Weismann)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cutting mice tails experiment.

New glass production, cutting, and shaping technologies made thin lenses possible for the first time. Designs for glass contact lenses that fit in the eye, allowing the wearer to blink, were independently invented by three men: Dr. Adolf Fick, Eugene Cult, and Louis J. Girard. Credit for the discovery usually goes to Dr. Fick, a Swiss physician who wrote a treatise entitled &ldquo;A Contact Spectacle,&rdquo; in which he described the first contact lens with refractive power for visual improvement. The first physical example of the lens was made by artificial eye-maker F. A. Mueller in 1887. These types of contact lenses were called scleral lenses, and they covered the entire eye, not just the cornea. They were slightly convex, allowing room for tears or a dextrose solution&mdash;the liquid that creates the refractive power to correct vision&mdash;to fill the eye much like Da Vinci&rsquo;s bowl of water. In 1888, Dr. Fick constructed and fitted the first successful contact lens. However, there were two major issues with Fick&rsquo;s contacts: the lenses were made from heavy blown glass and were 18&ndash;21mm in diameter. The weight alone made them uncomfortable to wear, but worse, the glass lenses covered the entire exposed eye. Unlike other bodily organs, which are oxygenated by the blood, the eyes get their oxygen directly from the air. So covering your eyeballs with glass shields is, essentially, suffocating them. Scleral lens wearers experienced excruciating eye pain after a few hours of use. Nonetheless, glass scleral lenses were the main form of contact lenses for the next 60 years.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.z4x9jhfonb6i"><span class="c3">1889</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.67hpdf592y4g"><span class="c7">Pangenes (De Vries)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In 1889, De Vries published his book &ldquo;Intracellular Pangenesis&rdquo;, in which, based on a modified version of Charles Darwin&#39;s theory of Pangenesis of 1868, he postulated that different characters have different hereditary carriers. He specifically postulated that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles. He called these units pangenes, a term 20 years later to be shortened to genes by Wilhelm Johannsen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To support his theory of pangenes, which was not widely noticed at the time, De Vries conducted a series of experiments hybridizing varieties of multiple plant species in the 1890s. Unaware of Mendel&#39;s work, De Vries used the laws of dominance and recessiveness, segregation, and independent assortment to explain the 3:1 ratio of phenotypes in the second generation. His observations also confirmed his hypothesis that the inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.utztmc95beae"><span class="c3">1890</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.j3xzuoycx14u"><span class="c7">Electric street cars (Paris, already existed)</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.h1untyt7r8vr"><span class="c7">Telephone exchanges (Paris, already existed)</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.m2am4hvrq211"><span class="c7">Moving pictures (Paris, already existed)</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.p9xzgwsjxe7r"><span class="c7">Structural formula for Benzene (Kekule)</span></h2><h1 class="c6" id="h.t15m3kiswao9"><span class="c3">1893</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.fvv0btpym4uy"><span class="c7">Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In 1893, a French physician, Jacques Bertillon, introduced the Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death at a congress of the International Statistical Institute in Chicago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A number of countries adopted Bertillon&#39;s system, which was based on the principle of distinguishing between general diseases and those localized to a particular organ or anatomical site, as used by the City of Paris for classifying deaths.

The tube that Roentgen was working with consisted of a glass envelope (bulb) with positive and negative electrodes encapsulated in it. The air in the tube was evacuated, and when a high voltage was applied, the tube produced a fluorescent glow.

In 1886, he had discovered new forms among a display of the evening primrose (Oenothera lamarckiana) growing wild in an abandoned potato field near Hilversum, having escaped a nearby garden.[6] Taking seeds from these, he found that they produced many new varieties in his experimental gardens; he introduced the term mutations for these suddenly appearing variations. In his two-volume publication The Mutation Theory (1900&ndash;1903) he postulated that evolution, especially the origin of species, might occur more frequently with such large-scale changes than via Darwinian gradualism, basically suggesting a form of saltationism. De Vries&#39;s theory was one of the chief contenders for the explanation of how evolution worked, leading, for example, Thomas Hunt Morgan to study mutations in the fruit fly, until the modern evolutionary synthesis became the dominant model in the 1930s. During the early decades of the twentieth century, de Vries&#39; theory was enormously influential and continued to fascinate non-biologists long after the scientific community had abandoned it.[7] The large-scale primrose variations turned out to be the result of various chromosomal abnormalities, including ring chromosomes, balanced lethals and chromosome duplications (polyploidy), while the term mutation now generally is restricted to discrete changes in the DNA sequence. However, the popular understanding of &quot;mutation&quot; as a sudden leap to a new species has remained a staple theme of science fiction, e.g. the X-Men movies (and the comic books that preceded them).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.esxfojllsbni"><span class="c7">Chromosome recombinations (De Vries)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, in a published lecture of 1903 (Befruchtung und Bastardierung, Veit, Leipzig), De Vries was also the first to suggest the occurrence of recombinations between homologous chromosomes, now known as chromosomal crossovers, within a year after chromosomes were implicated in Mendelian inheritance by Walter Sutton.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.f9r9tvj9d2oy"><span class="c3">1905</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.mlaqr5y710kk"><span class="c7">Genetics (Bateson)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The term &ldquo;genetics&rdquo; was born for the science that was earlier an unnamed study of heredity and variation.</span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.8kfb525g53rh"><span class="c7">Special relativity (Einstein)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ideas outlined in Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion and universal gravitation stood unchallenged for nearly 220 years until Albert Einstein presented his theory of special relativity in 1905.

All of us moving through the universe on the Earth are in a single frame of reference, but an astronaut in a fast-moving spaceship would be in a different reference frame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Within a single frame of reference, the laws of classical physics, including Newton&rsquo;s laws, hold true. But Newton&rsquo;s laws can&rsquo;t explain the differences in motion, mass, distance, and time that result when objects are observed from two very different frames of reference. To describe motion in these situations, scientists must rely on Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At slow speeds and at large scales, however, the differences in time, length, and mass predicted by relativity are small enough that they appear to be constant, and Newton&rsquo;s laws still work. In general, few things are moving at speeds fast enough for us to notice relativity. For large, slow-moving satellites, Newton&rsquo;s laws still define orbits. We can still use them to launch Earth-observing satellites and predict their motion. We can use them to reach the Moon, Mars, and other places beyond Earth. For this reason, many scientists see Einstein&rsquo;s laws of general and special relativity not as a replacement of Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion and universal gravitation, but as the full culmination of his idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.rdsk21lsaexp"><span class="c7">Theory of photoelectric effect (Einstein)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.5ndv7idgt2no"><span class="c3">1907</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.iawr9byeqos7"><span class="c7">Alpha radiation is Helium (Rutherford, Royds)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube.

In 1909, he discovered that a chemical called arsphenamine was an effective treatment for syphilis. This became the first modern antibiotic, although Ehrlich himself referred to his discovery as &#39;chemotherapy&#39; &ndash; the use of a chemical to treat a disease. The word &#39;antibiotics&#39; was first used over 30 years later by the Ukrainian-American inventor and microbiologist Selman Waksman, who in his lifetime discovered over 20 antibiotics.</span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.c6wsqv4y0mea"><span class="c7">pH scale</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The development of the pH scale allows scientists to define the acidity of a substance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.7sibrnyi7hs4"><span class="c7">The North Pole Expedition</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only a year later, Vaseline&reg; Jelly played an integral role on what is thought to be the first successful expedition to the North Pole with Commander Robert Peary.

Castle, around 1908 Morgan started working on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and encouraged students to do so as well. With Fernandus Payne, he mutated Drosophila through physical, chemical, and radiational means. He began cross-breeding experiments to find heritable mutations, but they had no significant success for two years. Castle had also had difficulty identifying mutations in Drosophila, which were tiny. Finally, in 1909, a series of heritable mutants appeared, some of which displayed Mendelian inheritance patterns; in 1910 Morgan noticed a white-eyed mutant male among the red-eyed wild types. When white-eyed flies were bred with a red-eyed female, their progeny were all red-eyed. A second generation cross produced white-eyed males&mdash;a sex-linked recessive trait, the gene for which Morgan named white. Morgan also discovered a pink-eyed mutant that showed a different pattern of inheritance. In a paper published in Science in 1911, he concluded that (1) some traits were sex-linked, (2) the trait was probably carried on one of the sex chromosomes, and (3) other genes were probably carried on specific chromosomes as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.2xbylnoo7ozw"><span class="c3">1913</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.90nn51ukgtf"><span class="c7">Blood group compatibility</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>Reuben Ottenberg (1882&ndash;1959), in New York, conclusively proved the necessity for crossmatching before transfusion by showing that antibodies in patients&rsquo; blood could be harmful to donors&rsquo; red cells.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.38cs56d6hc38"><span class="c3">1914</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.z5iebeod9xd1"><span class="c7">GREAT WAR S</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.uo3trktuiioq"><span class="c7">Zur Frage der Entstehung maligner Tumoren (Boveri)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c10"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Concerning-Origin-Malignant-Tumours-Theodor/dp/0879697881/ref%3Dsr_1_2?dchild%3D1%26keywords%3Dboveri%26qid%3D1599867561%26s%3Dbooks%26sr%3D1-2&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1602013741108000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fjCZPMbKnIyzS9jLHC9Lh">https://www.amazon.com/Concerning-Origin-Malignant-Tumours-Theodor/dp/0879697881/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=boveri&amp;qid=1599867561&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2</a></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.7vvzcvmr11mx"><span class="c7">Moseley&#39;s law (staircase)</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.170fs4ibkyo1"><span class="c7">Anticoagulant</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In 1914 Albert Hustin (1882&ndash;1967), in Brussels, and Luis Agote (1868&ndash;1954), in Buenos Aires, discovered that blood clotting could be stopped by the addition of the calcium chelator sodium citrate.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.z76ennkvluhg"><span class="c3">1915</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.el1fav6lgjha"><span class="c7">Chromosomal theory of inheritance (Morgan)</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.nnpx4mwbnslj"><span class="c7">General relativity (Einstein)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>This theory explained the anomaly that the orbit of the planet Mercury around the Sun did not quite agree with predictions based on Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravity.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.xa9kxi2jcfu4"><span class="c3">1916</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.1uebjwoh73r0"><span class="c7">Blood preservation</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>In 1916 Peyton Rous and J.

Unbreakable, scratch-resistant, malleable, and easy to manufacture plastic revolutionized the contact lens industry, making glass lenses quickly become obsolete. But even though the new lenses were plastic, they were still scleral lenses, covering the entire eye and only wearable for a few hours at a time.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.5gycff43henl"><span class="c3">1930</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.rp9f2cl3ybxi"><span class="c7">Cyclotron</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.m5xu40vz8w7i"><span class="c7">Interstellar extinction explained (Trumpler)</span></h2><h1 class="c6" id="h.1j8sah9qtjrm"><span class="c3">1932</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.sxaehlnwe16x"><span class="c7">Neutron (Chadwick)</span></h2><h2 class="c4" id="h.5jkyi2tc9nhf"><span class="c7">Atom split experiment (Cockcroft and Walton)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First experiment to split the nucleus using particle accelerator in a fully controlled manner was performed by students working under Rutherford direction, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.y960vu6zov0m"><span class="c3">1933</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.dm20m5mjlcjd"><span class="c7">Portable pH meters</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Scientists develop portable pH meters</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.mxcmmgjgnmyv"><span class="c3">1934</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.6ubky4m3wsq9"><span class="c7">Neutron nucleus attack (Fermi)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fermi began firing neutrons at Uranium atoms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.gottsl2nay1t"><span class="c3">1937</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.8rf8awij0bt"><span class="c7">Rochelle salt is monoclinic</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">JAFFE, HANS, Phu8.

This conflicts with the statement that Rochelle salt crystals are orthorhombic with 3 two-fold axes of symmetry. That both statements are true and do not conflict, became evident in 1937 when Jaffe discovered that the salt is monoclinic at temperatures between +24&quot;C and -lS&deg;C. Above 24&#39; and below - 18&#39; it is rhombic. It is evident that only the monoclinic crystals are ferroelectric. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.ms5iqcyjh11x"><span class="c7">National Cancer Institute (NIH U.S.)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.ennhge2ctbtz"><span class="c3">1938</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.fe0d5tn6qvma"><span class="c7">Nuclear fission</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Uranium atom was split in two by german scientists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.ly0qpscnfa9y"><span class="c7">Cline (Huxley)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In biology, a cline is a measurable gradient in a single character of a species across its geographical range.

In addition to the nuclear fission products reported by Hahn and Strassmann, they detected two unusual radioactive isotopes, one with a half-life of about 2.3 days, and the other with one of around 23 minutes. McMillan identified the short-lived isotope as uranium-239, which had been reported by Hahn and Strassmann.
