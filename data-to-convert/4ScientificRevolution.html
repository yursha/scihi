Galileo discovered through this experiment that the objects fell with the same acceleration, proving his prediction true, while at the same time disproving Aristotle&#39;s theory of gravity (which states that objects fall at speed proportional to their mass). He formulated a law which predicted that bodies of the same material falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than the lighter ones,and in direct proportion to their weight. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Galileo&rsquo;s thought experiment which was a precursor to the theory was as follows: Imagine two objects, one light and one heavier than the other one, are connected to each other by a string. Drop this system of objects from the top of a tower. If we assume heavier objects do indeed fall faster than lighter ones (and conversely, lighter objects fall slower), the string will soon pull taut as the lighter object retards the fall of the heavier object. But the system considered as a whole is heavier than the heavy object alone, and therefore should fall faster. This contradiction leads one to conclude the assumption is false.</span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.em1da3ro13gc"><span class="c5">1590</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.mmkrddi21ik2"><span class="c2">Compound microscope</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Credit for the first compound microscope goes to Zacharias Jannsen and his father Hans, both Dutch spectacle makers, around 1590.

He first employed free swinging pendulums in simple timing applications. His physician friend, Santorio Santorii, invented a device which measured a patient&#39;s pulse by the length of a pendulum; the pulsilogium.[28] In 1641 Galileo conceived and dictated to his son Vincenzo a design for a pendulum clock;[32] Vincenzo began construction, but had not completed it when he died in 1649.[33] The pendulum was the first harmonic oscillator used by man.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Galileo starts using pendulums as time measuring devices in 1602.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.m5ryo5lc5umn"><span class="c2">Snell&rsquo;s law (Harriot)</span></h2><h1 class="c9" id="h.rym3jv2a7tce"><span class="c5">1604</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.48s0ijn0bnkn"><span class="c2">Kepler&rsquo;s supernova (Brunowsky)</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>On October 9 1604 astronomers in a few Italian cities discovered a new star - a nova- that rapidly became brighter than all the stars in the sky.

A ball rolled down the inclined plane, then on the horizontal table, eventually shooting off the table&rsquo;s edge along a trajectory that finally hit the ground. By measuring the horizontal and vertical distances traveled, and by understanding that the horizontal motion (while in the air) is nearly at a uniform speed (since only the air resistance acts to slow it down slightly), while the vertical motion is in free fall, he was able to determine the geometrical shape of the trajectory. Basically, the vertical distance through which the body falls is proportional to the square of the horizontal distance travelled. That is, a ball that travels twice farther horizontally falls four times farther vertically.

Although it had been believed since antiquity that the planets, being heavenly bodies, were perfect and therefore could move only in perfect circles or combinations of circles, Copernicus had correctly classified the Earth as one of the planets; and it was fully accepted that the Earth was far removed from perfection. Kepler extended Copernicus&#39; reasoning to the other planets and was the first to declare that the other planets resemble the Earth in being material bodies. That a material body, being imperfect, need not travel in a perfectly circular orbit was a conclusion made by Kepler after he tried unsuccessfully to fit the orbit of Mars to Brahe&#39;s observations in every possible combination of circles his ingenuity could devise. Because none of them worked, he tried non circular paths until he found the true solution: Mars revolves in an elliptical orbit with the Sun occupying one of its two focuses.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Like many philosophers of his era, Kepler had a mystical belief that the circle was the Universe&rsquo;s perfect shape, and that as a manifestation of Divine order, the planets&rsquo; orbits must be circular. For many years, he struggled to make Brahe&rsquo;s observations of the motions of Mars match up with a circular orbit.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Eventually, however, Kepler noticed that an imaginary line drawn from a planet to the Sun swept out an equal area of space in equal times, regardless of where the planet was in its orbit. If you draw a triangle out from the Sun to a planet&rsquo;s position at one point in time and its position at a fixed time later&mdash;say, 5 hours, or 2 days&mdash;the area of that triangle is always the same, anywhere in the orbit. For all these triangles to have the same area, the planet must move more quickly when it is near the Sun, but more slowly when it is farthest from the Sun.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This discovery (which became Kepler&rsquo;s second law of orbital motion) led to the realization of what became Kepler&rsquo;s first law: that the planets move in an ellipse (a squashed circle) with the Sun at one focus point, offset from the center.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Using the precise data that Tycho had collected, Kepler discovered that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse.

For example, a block of wood pushed at constant speed across a table quickly comes to rest when we stop pushing. Thus, Aristotle held that objects at rest remained at rest unless a force acted on them, but that objects in motion did not remain in motion unless a force acted constantly on them. Galileo, by virtue of a series of experiments (many with objects sliding down inclined planes), realized that the analysis of Aristotle was incorrect because it failed to account properly for a hidden force: the </span><span class="c0">frictional</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;force between the surface and the object.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Thus, as we push the block of wood across the table, there are two opposing forces that act: the force associated with the push, and a force that is associated with the friction and that acts in the opposite direction. Galileo realized that as the frictional forces were decreased (for example, by placing oil on the table) the object would move further and further before stopping. From this he abstracted a basic form of the law of inertia: if the frictional forces could be reduced to exactly zero (not possible in a realistic experiment, but it can be approximated to high precision) an object pushed at constant speed across a frictionless surface of infinite extent will continue at that speed forever after we stop pushing, unless a new force acts on it at a later time.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Translated Quote from one of Galileo&#39;s Journals:</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c8">A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by raising one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We repeated this experiment more than once in order to measure the time with an accuracy such that the deviation between two observations never exceeded one-tenth of a pulse-beat. Having performed this operation and having assured ourselves of its reliability, we now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, compared the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated a full hundred times, we always found that the spaces traversed were to each other as the squares of the times, and this was true for all inclinations of the plane, i.e., of the channel, along which we rolled the ball. We also observed that the times of descent, for various inclinations of the plane, bore to one another precisely that ratio which, as we shall see later, the Author had predicted and demonstrated for them.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c18 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">For the measurement of time, we employed a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Only in his later book Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences (Discorsi) published in 1638, did Galileo arrive at a correct theory of free fall, according to which , in a vacuum, all bodies, irrespective of their weights or densities, uniformly </span><span>accelerate</span><span>&nbsp;in precisely the same way.

In this sense, a free-falling body could be thought of as a ball rolling down a vertical plane.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.hfm52yf10geu"><span class="c5">1639</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.uvjd8s5rueqe"><span class="c2">Transit of Venus observed (Horrocks, Grabtree)</span></h2><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.evxdizwx7jql"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Essai pour les coniques&quot; (Pascal)</span></h2><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.tvsk3wl048mi"><span class="c5">1641</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.aal2bvfo1q8f"><span class="c2">Trattato del moto (Torricelli)</span></h2><h1 class="c9" id="h.92h1kb4kbiny"><span class="c5">1643</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.if0owje9zs9v"><span class="c2">Barometer (Torricelli)</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Torricelli was a student of Galileo.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0 c23"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">1643 - Evangelista Torricelli</span><span>&nbsp;proposed that the weight of the atmosphere, not an attracting force of the vacuum, held the water in the tube.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">He thought that the level the water stayed at (c. 10.3 m) was reflective of the force of the air&#39;s weight pushing on it (specifically, pushing on the water in the basin and thus limiting how much water can fall from the tube into it).</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.hviny22sbwwh"><span class="c5">1644</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.73ut5c111uox"><span class="c2">Opera geometrica (Torricelli)</span></h2><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.38czxfkvz12q"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Principia Philosophiae&rdquo; (Descartes)</span></h2><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.ad09z7bujltf"><span class="c5">1646</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.2tycac5qfrw4"><span class="c2">Chemical garden (Glauber)</span></h2><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The chemical garden (or silica garden) was first observed by Glauber and described by him in 1646.

Fermat&#39;s ideas were an extension of those of Hero of Alexandria. Fermat&#39;s (correct) derivation of the law of refraction depended crucially on his (correct) assumption that light travels more slowly in dense media than it does in air. Unfortunately, many famous scientists, including Newton, maintained that light travels faster in dense media than it does in air. This erroneous idea held up progress in optics for over one hundred years, and was not conclusively disproved until the mid-nineteenth century.

These experiments failed, as the blood clotted. In 1666, however, he had some success. He bled a dog until it was moribund and then, having exposed a large artery in the neck of another dog, he placed a reed between the artery and vein and blood flowed into the moribund dog. He described how tying the jugular vein was safe and that the dog could survive with one jugular vein. The dog leaped from the table, shook himself, and then ran away as if nothing had happened.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Robert Boyle, also a Fellow of the Royal Society, proposed a number of questions for Lower, including whether a dog&rsquo;s disposition could be altered by blood transfusions; in other words, could a dog lose its acquired habit of fetching and carrying or &lsquo;dive after ducks&rsquo; (5)? What intrigues us now are the philosophical questions raised by these experiments, namely, the possibility of transferring acquired characteristics from one animal or human to another. These questions reflected the view that blood contained spirits that could possibly be transferred from one individual to another, a belief dating back to the Greeks or even earlier. Did these serious thinkers really believe that blood contained spirits and that its transfusion could alter behaviour of the recipient? Apparently they did.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.5f663ktwx3t8"><span class="c5">1667</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.eg8hwtmhc8y2"><span class="c2">Animal-human blood transfusion</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>In 1667, at a meeting of the Royal Society, Richard Lower transfused blood from a sheep into the arm vein of Arthur Coga in the belief that the mental health of the latter could be improved by this process.

Denys went on to carry out probably the most notorious animal-to-human transfusion, one which was to undermine the reputation of blood transfusion. He recommended blood transfusion from a calf as treatment for a man who appeared to be mentally disturbed. The description of what happened after the transfusion was obviously a haemolytic transfusion reaction: back pain, intravascular haemolysis, and haemoglobinuria. The patient died following a further attempt at transfusion. It later transpired that the patient&rsquo;s wife had poisoned him with arsenic; however, by that point the reputation of blood transfusion in France had been severely damaged. Eleven years later, the French Parliament deemed transfusion a criminal act. The Royal Society soon followed suit and began to distance itself from blood transfusion, and the following year Pope Innocent XI (1629&ndash;91) banned the practice.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.21bebpw47r96"><span class="c5">1668</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.hehlkqtqvtvr"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Logarithmo-technia&rdquo; (Meractor)</span></h2><h1 class="c9" id="h.nyn00fu9qdkj"><span class="c5">1671</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.gzezy1ffl5pv"><span class="c2">Metal - acid reactions (Boyle)</span></h2><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids.
