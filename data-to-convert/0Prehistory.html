It is sometimes found free in nature, but is usually obtained from the ores stibnite (Sb2S3) and valentinite (Sb2O3). The ancient Egyptians used antimony, in the form of stibnite, for black eye make-up. Antimony was known to medieval alchemists, and the date of its discovery is generally accepted to be around 1450. Whilst recognised in its elemental form from around 1450, the natural sulphide of antimony (stibnite) was known in Biblical times, and used extensively in the ancient world as a cosmetic. Because of its distinctive dark colour and opacity, stibnite was ground and used as a pigment in the middle ages. Nicolas L&eacute;mery, a French chemist, was the first person to scientifically study antimony and its compounds. He published his findings in 1707. </span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.k8qji4ubz6v"><span class="c8">Native metals</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A native metal is the uncombined form of metal that occurs in nature.

Around five thousand years later, the people of Egypt and Mesopotamia are said to have invented plant-based tanning, using the bark of Acacia nilotica, or the gum arabic tree. Plant-based tanning is a slow process that uses tannins occurring naturally in the bark and leaves of plants, most commonly mimosa, chestnut, and bark and results in a stiff leather. Plant tanning was not the only method known to the Egyptians. Craftsmen already knew much about tanning methods based on sesame oil and the mineral alum. The Romans circa 800 BCE tanned a variety of leather&mdash;tough corium leather for sandals as well as a supple leather they named aluta&mdash;using the process now commonly known as alum tanning. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the oldest tanning processes in existence utilizes an unusual method. People living in colder climates, such as present-day Greenland or Alaska, would work with hides, particularly seal skins, using ulo knives or special stone scrapers to remove the hair. They would then tumble or beat the skins and consequently soften them with urine. After this, the leather workers, who were primarily women, would use their teeth to masticate the hides until they became very soft and then prepare them with fat and fish oil. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Another tanning method can be reconstructed from leather garments dating from the fifth century BCE that were discovered, well preserved in ice, in Greenland. First, the hide&rsquo;s layer of fat was removed with clay and it was then covered with a mixture of animal brain, liver, fat, and salt. The hides were then sewn together into a round tent with needles made from bone or horn and smoked over an open fire&mdash;present in the smoke was phenol, an active tanning ingredient. An archaic method of natural vegetable tanning can still be observed today in Morocco&rsquo;s royal cities Marrakesh and Fez, where tanneries rigorously ensure that all their coloring agents are natural and plant-based: bell pepper or red poppy for bright red, rose for pink, henna for orange, henna mixed with sugar for black, indigo for blue, mint for green, and pomegranate with saffron to create yellow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The dyeing of leather is likely as old as tanning. Since ancient times, humans have decorated leather and used it to adorn themselves. Once humans began to wear animal skins, they soon tried to color them with the juice of plants&mdash;indeed, perhaps this desire for adornment is what spurred the invention of vegetable tanning. Some of the earliest known leather decoration techniques such as tooling, stamping, gilding, dyeing, and painting originated in Asia and had a strong influence on subsequent European leather and jewelry artisans&rsquo; choice of ornamentation and motifs. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the preferred method of ornamentation was leather cutting, an ornamental or figurative drawing cut into the grain side of the leather and emphasized by driving it from the fleshy side. Punching, another common ornamental technique requiring plant-tanned leather, is derived from the Italian word punzone, meaning &ldquo;stamp,&rdquo; in which a steel rod of varying size and shape is used to emboss moist leather.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While dyes of the past were natural compounds, today most are aniline dyes. Aniline refers to the synthetic oil produced from the tar of hard coal; a colorless, odorless, and poisonous substance, the aniline component is no longer widely used due to environmental and health concerns. Aniline dyeing in the modern sense uses water-soluble transparent dye to conserve the natural character of leather and produces among the finest quality leather available. By using natural or lesser-impact leather processes, we can now cover our feet and bodies directly with leather products without toxins or allergens, therewith leather producers take responsibility not only for the workers, the products, and the environment, but also for future generations. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the ancient art of alchemy, mercury, sulfur, and salt were the Earth&rsquo;s three principle substances. Believing that mercury was at the core of all metals, alchemists supposed that gold, silver, copper, tin, lead and iron were all mixtures of mercury and other substances.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the era before antibiotics, sexually-transmitted diseases were deadly. Some scholars believe that syphilis was the most critical medical problem of the first half of the 16th century. A great number of printed works dealing with syphilis first appeared at the end of the 15th century when it was known by such names as &ldquo;morbus gallicius,&rdquo; &ldquo;the French disease,&rdquo; &ldquo;the pox,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lues venera.&rdquo; In the desperate search for a cure, it was almost inevitable that various forms of mercury would be tried. Indeed, the treatment appeared to benefit some patients. While it is unclear whether mercury actually did cure syphilis (some cases of the disease resolve spontaneously), the use of mercury therapy continued into the early 20th century.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Metals like iron or tin or lead have been known for centuries.</span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.30isycu7yq0z"><span class="c6">Bronze Age</span></h1><h2 class="c1" id="h.9tcxe6u6yqu1"><span class="c8">Metallurgy</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Certain metals can be recovered from their ores by simply heating the rocks in a fire: notably, tin, lead, and (at a higher temperature) copper.
