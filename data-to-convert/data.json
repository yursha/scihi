This proves that Aristotle is wrong\u201d.[5]Between 1589\u00a0and 1592\u00a0Galileo Galilei\u00a0dropped two spheres of different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. Galileo discovered through this experiment that the objects fell with the same acceleration, proving his prediction true, while at the same time disproving Aristotle's theory of gravity (which states that objects fall at speed proportional to their mass). He formulated a law which predicted that bodies of the same material falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than the lighter ones,and in direct proportion to their weight. Galileo\u2019s thought experiment which was a precursor to the theory was as follows: Imagine two objects, one light and one heavier than the other one, are connected to each other by a string. Drop this system of objects from the top of a tower. If we assume heavier objects do indeed fall faster than lighter ones (and conversely, lighter objects fall slower), the string will soon pull taut as the lighter object retards the fall of the heavier object. But the system considered as a whole is heavier than the heavy object alone, and therefore should fall faster. This contradiction leads one to conclude the assumption is false.",

There was the need to solve a theoretical and practical problem: a suction pump could only raise water up to a height of 10 metres (34 ft). In the early 1600s, Galileo\u00a0argued that suction pumps were able to draw water from a well because of the \"force of vacuum.\" This argument, however, failed to explain the fact that suction pumps could only raise water to a height of 10 metres. At the time the existence of vacuums was controversial.On July 27, 1630, Giovanni Baliani\u00a0wrote a letter to Galileo Galilei\u00a0explaining an experiment he had made in which a siphon, led over a hill about twenty-one meters high, failed to work. Galileo responded with an explanation of the phenomenon: he proposed that it was the power of a vacuum that held the water up, and at a certain height the amount of water simply became too much and the force could not hold any more, like a cord that can support only so much weight. This was a restatement of the theory of horror vacui (\"nature abhors a vacuum\"), which dates to Aristotle, and which Galileo restated as resistenza del vacuo.Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u00a0described the design of an experiment to determine atmospheric pressure as early as 1631, but there is no evidence that he built a pressure-measuring device at that time.Inspired by Galileo Galilei\u00a0theory, between 1639\u00a0and 1641\u00a0- Raffaele Magiotti\u00a0devised an experiment to test for the existence of vacuum. Gasparo Berti\u00a0carried out this experiment and may unintentionally have built a water barometer. He built an 11 m lead tube, filled it with water, and sealed both ends. He submerged one end in a water basin and unsealed it. Though some of the water flowed out into the basin, much of it remained in the tube, filling about 10.3 m (34 feet) of the tube, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. What was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water. Berti claimed that the space above was filled with a vacuum. His claim was strongly contested, and multiple experiments were performed attempting to disprove the existence of a vacuum. This experiment led to Evangelista Torricelli's\u00a0research into the weight of air and his invention of the barometer.",

He first employed free swinging pendulums in simple timing applications. His physician friend, Santorio Santorii, invented a device which measured a patient's pulse by the length of a pendulum; the pulsilogium.[28] In 1641 Galileo conceived and dictated to his son Vincenzo a design for a pendulum clock;[32] Vincenzo began construction, but had not completed it when he died in 1649.[33] The pendulum was the first harmonic oscillator used by man.Galileo starts using pendulums as time measuring devices in 1602.[8]",

This event was evidence that the realm of the fixed stars, considered since ancient times as pure and changeless, could indeed experience change.

All of the rays are then refracted within the normal eye to meet again at a single point on the retina, identified by Kepler as the sensitive receptor of the eye. If the eye is not normal, the second short interior cone comes to a point not on the retina but in front of it or behind it, causing blurred vision. For more than three centuries eyeglasses had helped older persons to see better. But nobody before Kepler was able to explain how these little pieces of curved glass had worked.",

This came out of an experiment conducted in 1608, which looked something like this: An inclined plane was placed on top of a horizontal tabletop. A ball rolled down the inclined plane, then on the horizontal table, eventually shooting off the table\u2019s edge along a trajectory that finally hit the ground. By measuring the horizontal and vertical distances traveled, and by understanding that the horizontal motion (while in the air) is nearly at a uniform speed (since only the air resistance acts to slow it down slightly), while the vertical motion is in free fall, he was able to determine the geometrical shape of the trajectory. Basically, the vertical distance through which the body falls is proportional to the square of the horizontal distance travelled. That is, a ball that travels twice farther horizontally falls four times farther vertically. The trajectory precisely delineates the curve known since antiquity as a parabola.[10]",

His work with optical devices grew out of his work as a spectacle maker, an industry that had started in Venice and Florence in the thirteenth century, and later expanded to the Netherlands and Germany.Lipperhey applied to the States General of the Netherlands on 2 October 1608 for a patent for his instrument \"for seeing things far away as if they were nearby\", a few weeks before another Dutch instrument-maker's patent, that of Jacob Metius. Lipperhey failed to receive a patent since the same claim for invention had also been made by other spectacle-makers but he was handsomely rewarded by the Dutch government for copies of his design.In late 1608 Galileo\u2019s Venetian friend Paolo Sarpi heard a rumor about a spyglass - an optical gadget invented in the Netherlands - that could make distant objects appear closer and larger. Realizing that such an instrument could have interesting applications, Sarpi alerted Galileo in 1609.[11]There are many stories as to how Lipperhey came by his invention. One version has Lipperhey observing two children playing with lenses in his shop and commenting how they could make a far away weather-vane seem closer when looking at it through two lenses. Other stories have Lipperhey's apprentice coming up with the idea or have Lipperhey copying someone else's discovery.[11] Lipperhey's original instrument consisted of either two convex lenses with an inverted image or a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens so it would have an upright image.[12] This \"Dutch perspective glass\" (the name \"telescope\" would not be coined until three years later by Giovanni Demisiani) had a three-times (or 3X) magnification.The design of these early refracting telescopes consisted of a convex objective lens and a concave eyepiece.",

The States General voted him a small award, although it ended up employing Lippershey to make binocular versions of the telescope. Metius is described as feeling rebuffed by the States General, withdrawing his patent, and not allowing anyone to see his telescope.[6] His will and testament ordered that all his tools and designs be destroyed to prevent anyone else from profiting from them.[7]",

            "description": "In his Astronomia Nova (\"New Astronomy\") of 1609, Kepler had demonstrated that the orbit of the planet Mars is an ellipse. Although it had been believed since antiquity that the planets, being heavenly bodies, were perfect and therefore could move only in perfect circles or combinations of circles, Copernicus had correctly classified the Earth as one of the planets; and it was fully accepted that the Earth was far removed from perfection. Kepler extended Copernicus' reasoning to the other planets and was the first to declare that the other planets resemble the Earth in being material bodies. That a material body, being imperfect, need not travel in a perfectly circular orbit was a conclusion made by Kepler after he tried unsuccessfully to fit the orbit of Mars to Brahe's observations in every possible combination of circles his ingenuity could devise. Because none of them worked, he tried non circular paths until he found the true solution: Mars revolves in an elliptical orbit with the Sun occupying one of its two focuses.Like many philosophers of his era, Kepler had a mystical belief that the circle was the Universe\u2019s perfect shape, and that as a manifestation of Divine order, the planets\u2019 orbits must be circular. For many years, he struggled to make Brahe\u2019s observations of the motions of Mars match up with a circular orbit.Eventually, however, Kepler noticed that an imaginary line drawn from a planet to the Sun swept out an equal area of space in equal times, regardless of where the planet was in its orbit. If you draw a triangle out from the Sun to a planet\u2019s position at one point in time and its position at a fixed time later\u2014say, 5 hours, or 2 days\u2014the area of that triangle is always the same, anywhere in the orbit. For all these triangles to have the same area, the planet must move more quickly when it is near the Sun, but more slowly when it is farthest from the Sun.This discovery (which became Kepler\u2019s second law of orbital motion) led to the realization of what became Kepler\u2019s first law: that the planets move in an ellipse (a squashed circle) with the Sun at one focus point, offset from the center.Using the precise data that Tycho had collected, Kepler discovered that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse. In 1609, he published Astronomia Nova delineating his discoveries, which are now called Kepler's first two laws of planetary motion.",

What is surprising about that? In an equal and grateful exchange, the Earth pays back the Moon with light equal to that which she received from the Moon almost all the time in the deepest darkness of the night\u2026 In this sequence [of lunar phases], then, in alternate succession, the lunar light bestows upon us her monthly illuminations, now brighter, now weaker. But the favor is repaid by the Earth in like manner.[14]About 10 months ago, a report reached my ears that a certain Fleming had constructed a spyglass by means of which visible objects, though very distant from the eye of the observer, were distinctly seen as if nearby. Of this truly remarkable effect, several experiences were related, to which some persons gave credence while others denied them. A few days later, the report was confirmed to me in a letter from a noble Frenchman at Paris, Jacques Badovere, which caused me to apply myself wholeheartedly to investigate means by which I might arrive at the invention of a similar instrument. This I did soon afterwards, my basis being the doctrine of refraction.[15]Galileo discovered through trial and error that by placing spectacle lenses in a tube, a plano-concave on at one end and a plano-convex one at the other, he could easily achieve a magnification of about three or four. Since Venice was an aspiring maritime power, Galileo immediately realized the bargaining potential that such a device (in his words: \u201cof inestimable value in all business and every undertaking at sea or on land\u201d) could give him in salary negotiations with Venetial senators. He therefore swiftly embarrassed on learning how to polish higher quality lenses, and experimented with lenses of different sizes and distances apart. Amazingly, within less than three weeks, he was in Venice, equipped with an eight-powered telescope and, through Sarpi\u2019s connections, about to demonstrate this \u201cperspicillum\u201d, as he called it, to Venetial decision-makers.[16]Galileo managed to improve his telescope to fifteen-power by November 1609 and to twenty-power or more by March 1610.[17]From the motions of the sun spots, Galileo estimated that the Sun takes approximately a month to rotate about its axis. Indeed, we know now that the solar rotation period at the equator is 24.47 days.[18]",

In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of double-convex converging lenses and double-concave diverging lenses\u2014and how they are combined to produce a Galilean telescope\u2014as well as the concepts of real vs. virtual images, upright vs. inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction.

            "description": "Perhaps Galileo's greatest contribution to physics was his formulation of the concept of inertia: an object in a state of motion possesses an ``inertia'' that causes it to remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it.Most objects in a state of motion do NOT remain in that state of motion. For example, a block of wood pushed at constant speed across a table quickly comes to rest when we stop pushing. Thus, Aristotle held that objects at rest remained at rest unless a force acted on them, but that objects in motion did not remain in motion unless a force acted constantly on them. Galileo, by virtue of a series of experiments (many with objects sliding down inclined planes), realized that the analysis of Aristotle was incorrect because it failed to account properly for a hidden force: the frictional\u00a0force between the surface and the object.Thus, as we push the block of wood across the table, there are two opposing forces that act: the force associated with the push, and a force that is associated with the friction and that acts in the opposite direction. Galileo realized that as the frictional forces were decreased (for example, by placing oil on the table) the object would move further and further before stopping. From this he abstracted a basic form of the law of inertia: if the frictional forces could be reduced to exactly zero (not possible in a realistic experiment, but it can be approximated to high precision) an object pushed at constant speed across a frictionless surface of infinite extent will continue at that speed forever after we stop pushing, unless a new force acts on it at a later time.Translated Quote from one of Galileo's Journals:A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by raising one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We repeated this experiment more than once in order to measure the time with an accuracy such that the deviation between two observations never exceeded one-tenth of a pulse-beat. Having performed this operation and having assured ourselves of its reliability, we now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, compared the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated a full hundred times, we always found that the spaces traversed were to each other as the squares of the times, and this was true for all inclinations of the plane, i.e., of the channel, along which we rolled the ball. We also observed that the times of descent, for various inclinations of the plane, bore to one another precisely that ratio which, as we shall see later, the Author had predicted and demonstrated for them.For the measurement of time, we employed a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.Only in his later book Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences (Discorsi) published in 1638, did Galileo arrive at a correct theory of free fall, according to which , in a vacuum, all bodies, irrespective of their weights or densities, uniformly accelerate\u00a0in precisely the same way. This crucial realization - the result of a vigorous experimental effort - was an essential prerequisite to Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation.[23]\u201cAlong a horizontal plane, the motion is uniform [constant speed], since here it experiences neither acceleration nor retardation. Any velocity imparted to a moving body will be rigidly maintained as long as the external causes of acceleration or retardation are removed, a condition which is [experimentally, approximately] found only on horizontal planes. This velocity would carry the body at a uniform rate to infinity\u201d.[24]To justify Galileo\u2019s Paduan experimental results with balls rolling down inclined planes as opposed to truly free-falling, Galileo had to show how the motion of such rolling balls is related to a body in free fall. To this goal, he noted that the speed balls reach after rolling down an inclined plane depends only on the vertical distance the balls had covered, and not on the angle at which the plane was titled. In this sense, a free-falling body could be thought of as a ball rolling down a vertical plane.[25]",

In spite of repeated attempts to prevent Elie from continuing his profession, he remained a manufacturing pharmacist till the end of his life. This fortunate reprieve was due in large part to the personal intervention of Louis XIV.It is quite likely that the synthesis of Rochelle salt by the Seignettes resulted from the inadvertent use of sodium carbonate instead of potassium carbonate, which they had hitherto used to make cream of tartar (acid potassium tartrate) more soluble.

Fermat's ideas were an extension of those of Hero of Alexandria. Fermat's (correct) derivation of the law of refraction depended crucially on his (correct) assumption that light travels more slowly in dense media than it does in air. Unfortunately, many famous scientists, including Newton, maintained that light travels faster in dense media than it does in air. This erroneous idea held up progress in optics for over one hundred years, and was not conclusively disproved until the mid-nineteenth century.

These experiments failed, as the blood clotted. In 1666, however, he had some success. He bled a dog until it was moribund and then, having exposed a large artery in the neck of another dog, he placed a reed between the artery and vein and blood flowed into the moribund dog. He described how tying the jugular vein was safe and that the dog could survive with one jugular vein. The dog leaped from the table, shook himself, and then ran away as if nothing had happened.[30]Robert Boyle, also a Fellow of the Royal Society, proposed a number of questions for Lower, including whether a dog\u2019s disposition could be altered by blood transfusions; in other words, could a dog lose its acquired habit of fetching and carrying or \u2018dive after ducks\u2019 (5)? What intrigues us now are the philosophical questions raised by these experiments, namely, the possibility of transferring acquired characteristics from one animal or human to another. These questions reflected the view that blood contained spirits that could possibly be transferred from one individual to another, a belief dating back to the Greeks or even earlier. Did these serious thinkers really believe that blood contained spirits and that its transfusion could alter behaviour of the recipient? Apparently they did.[31]",

The transfusion lasted for a few minutes, and no untoward effects were recorded.[32]\u00a0Jean-Baptiste Denys conducted a number of animal-to-human transfusions and submitted a report to the Royal Society in July 1667. Denys went on to carry out probably the most notorious animal-to-human transfusion, one which was to undermine the reputation of blood transfusion. He recommended blood transfusion from a calf as treatment for a man who appeared to be mentally disturbed. The description of what happened after the transfusion was obviously a haemolytic transfusion reaction: back pain, intravascular haemolysis, and haemoglobinuria. The patient died following a further attempt at transfusion. It later transpired that the patient\u2019s wife had poisoned him with arsenic; however, by that point the reputation of blood transfusion in France had been severely damaged. Eleven years later, the French Parliament deemed transfusion a criminal act. The Royal Society soon followed suit and began to distance itself from blood transfusion, and the following year Pope Innocent XI (1629\u201391) banned the practice.[33]\u00a0",

Among the later creators was John Dalton, who later eventually became aware of Hadley's priority. During the second half of the 19th century the theory gradually became known as \"Hadley's principle\".In 1686, Edmond Halley had proposed a theory in an attempt to explain the trade winds, a theory which remained the most widely known internationally almost to the beginning of the 19th century. George Hadley's version recognised that the Earth's rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass moving relative to the Earth, an element that had been missing in Halley's proposal. Later, in the second half of the 19th century, Hadley's theory was itself shown to be deficient in that it was based on an assumption that when air mass travels from one latitude to another its linear momentum is conserved. However, since the air mass is at all times in a state of circumnavigating the Earth axis, it is in fact the angular momentum that is conserved, causing an effect known as the Coriolis effect. When using the correct angular momentum conservation in calculations the predicted effect is twice as large as when the erroneous conservation of linear momentum is used.",

As the microbes did not reappear as long as the material was hermetically sealed, he proposed that microbes move through the air and that they could be killed through boiling. Needham argued that experiments destroyed the \"vegetative force\" that was required for spontaneous generation to occur. Spallanzani paved the way for research by Louis Pasteur, who defeated the theory of spontaneous generation almost a century later.",

His hypothesis was that combustion and respiration were one and the same and combustion occurs with every instance of respiration. In 1784, with his friend Pierre-Simon Laplace, he designed an ingenious ice-calorimeter to measure the amount of emitted heat during combustion and respiration. This apparatus consisted of three chambers: the inside chamber held the source of heat, a live guinea pig or a piece of burning charcoal; the middle one held a specific amount of ice for the heat source to melt; and the outside chamber held packed snow for insulation. Moreover, they connected a sleeve in a separate container to collect the \u2018fixed air\u2019 that was given off during combustion or respiration. They measured the quantifiable and specific amount of caloric and \u2018fixed air\u2019 produced during respiration and concluded that respiration is combustion (la respiration est une combustion) that occurs in the lungs and enables the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings.",

He was the first to show that fertilisation requires both spermatozoa and an ovum. He was the first to perform in vitro fertilization, with frogs, and an artificial insemination, using a dog.[9] Spallanzani showed that some animals, especially newts, can regenerate some parts of their body if injured or surgically removed.[2]In spite of his scientific background, Spallanzani endorsed preformationism, an idea that organisms develop from their own miniature selves; e.g. animals from minute animals, animalcules. In 1784, he performed a filtration experiment in which he successfully separated seminal fluid of frogs \u2013 a liquid portion and a gelatinous animalcule (spermatozoa) portion. But then he assumed that it was the liquid part which could induce fertilisation. A staunch ovist, he believed that animal form was already developed in the eggs and fertilisation by semen was only an activation for growth.[10]",

Mr de Morveau\u00a0is at present engaged in publishing the article Affinity in the Methodical Encyclop\u00e6dia; and I had more reasons than one to decline entering upon a work in which he is employed.\u201d\u201c Becher\u00a0assumes the existence of three kinds of earth, from the combination of which, in different proportions, he supposed all the varieties of metallic substances to be produced. Stahl\u00a0gave a new modification to this system\u201d\u201cThe acids, for example, are compounded of two substances, of the order of those which we consider as simple; the one constitutes acidity, and is common to all acids, and, from this substance, the name of the class or the genus ought to be taken; the other is peculiar to each acid, and distinguishes it from the rest, and from this substance is to be taken the name of the species. But, in the greatest number of acids, the two constituent elements, the acidifying principle, and that which it acidifies, may exist in different proportions, constituting all the possible points of equilibrium or of saturation. This is the case in the sulphuric and the sulphurous acids; and these two states of the same acid we have marked by varying the termination of the specific name.\u201d\u201cThe names, besides, which were formerly employed, such as powder of algaroth, salt of alembroth, pompholix, phagadenic water, turbith mineral, colcathar, and many others, were neither less barbarous nor less uncommon. It required a great deal of practice, and no small degree of memory, to recollect the substances to which they were applied, much more to recollect the genus of combination to which they belonged. The names of oil of tartar per deliquium, oil of vitriol, butter of arsenic and of antimony, flowers of zinc, &c. were still more improper, because they suggested false ideas: For, in the whole mineral kingdom, and particularly in the metallic class, there exists no such thing as butters, oils, or flowers; and, in short, the substances to which they give these fallacious names, are nothing less than rank poisons.\u201d\u201cIn the present state of our knowledge, we are unable to determine whether light be a modification of caloric, or if caloric be, on the contrary, a modification of light.\u201d",

He managed to capture three wild bats in Scandiono, and performed similar experiment, on which he wrote (on 20 August 1793):Having seen this, the candle was taken away, and for my eyes like for those of my brother and cousins we were in complete darkness. Yet the animals continued to fly around as before and never struck against obstacles, nor did they fall down, as would have happened with a night-bird. Thus a place which we believe to be completely dark is not at all so, because bats certainly could not see without light.A few days later he took two bats and covered their eyes with opaque disc made of birdlime. To his astonishment, both bats flew completely normally. He went further by surgically removing the eyeballs of one bat, which he observed as:[The bat] flew quickly, following the different subterranean pathways from one end to the other with the speed and sureness of an uninjured bat. More than once the animal landed on the walls and at the roof of the sotterranei and finally it landed in a hole in the ceiling two inches wide, hiding itself there immediately. My astonishment at this bat which absolutely could see although deprived of its eyes is inexpressible.[13]He concluded that bats do not need vision for navigation; although he failed to find the reason. At the time other scientists were sceptical and ridiculed his findings.[9] A contemporary of Spallanzani, the Swiss physician and naturalist Louis Jurine, learned of Spallanzani's experiments, investigated the possible mechanism of bat navigation. He discovered that bat flight was disoriented when their ears were plugged.[14] But Spallanzani did not believe that it was about hearing since bats flew very silently. He repeated his experiments by using improved ear plugs using turpentine, wax, pomatum or tinder mixed with water, to find that blinded bats could not navigate without hearing.[15] He was still suspicious that deafness alone was the cause of disoriented flight and that hearing was vital that he conducted some rather painful experiments such as burning and removing the external ear, and piercing through the inner ear. After these operations, he became convinced that hearing was fundamental to normal bat flight, upon which he noted:This experiment, which is so decisively in favor of hearing ... has been repeated by me with equal results both in blinded bats and in seeing one.[13]By then he was too convinced that he suggested the ear was an organ of navigation, writing:The experiments of M. Professor Jurine, confirming by many examples those which I have done, and varied in many ways, establish without doubt the influence of the ear in the flight of blinded bats. Can it then still be said that ... [for bats] their ears rather than their eyes serve to direct them in flight?[15]The exact scientific principle was discovered only in 1938 by two American biologists Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos.[16][17]",

With this he showed that each had the same proportion of weights between the three elements involved (Cu, C, O). Between the two types of the other compounds, Proust showed that no intermediate compounds exist between them.

Steady supply of electric current made possible new kinds of experiments involving electric current.

For a given mass of an ideal gas, the volume and amount (moles) of the gas are directly proportional if the temperature and pressure are constant. As an example, equal volumes of molecular hydrogen and nitrogen contain the same number of molecules when they are at the same temperature and pressure, and observe ideal gas behavior. In practice, real gases show small deviations from the ideal behavior and the law holds only approximately, but is still a useful approximation for scientists.Avogadro's Law states that the relationship between the masses of the same volume of all gases (at the same temperature and pressure) corresponds to the relationship between their respective molecular weights. Hence, the relative molecular mass of a gas can be calculated from the mass of a sample of known volume.The hypothesis was first published by Amadeo Avogadro in 1811 and it reconciled Dalton atomic theory with the \"incompatible\" idea of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac that some gases were composite of different fundamental substances (molecules) in integer proportions.Gay-Lussac also believed such a proportionality must exist, but what made Avogadro's hypothesis complete and correct was his new definition of a molecule as the smallest characteristic particle of a substance which may be a single elementary atom or a permanent union of several elementary atoms. He proposed that some gases, such as hydrogen and oxygen, consisted of diatomic molecules and a water molecule could consist of three elementary atoms, two of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Avogadro's concepts reconciled Dalton's atomic hypothesis with Gay-Lussac's law of combining volumes.",

            "description": "Liebig developed his version of an apparatus for determining the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of organic substances.A kaliapparat is a laboratory device for the analysis of carbon in organic compounds. The device, made of glass, consists of a series of five bulbs connected and arranged in a triangular shape.To determine the carbon in an organic compound with a kaliapparat, the substance is first burned, converting any carbon present into carbon dioxide (CO2). The vaporous products are passed through the kaliapparat, which is filled with potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The potassium hydroxide reacts with the CO2 to make potassium carbonate. The reaction, ignoring ionic dissociation, can be written as follows:2 KOH + CO2 \u2192 K2CO3 + H2O.Subtracting the mass of the kaliapparat before the combustion from that found after the combustion gives the amount of CO2 absorbed. From the mass of CO2 thus found, standard stoichiometric calculations then give the mass of carbon in the original sample.Before reaching the Kaliapparat, the combustion gases were conducted through a tube of hygroscopic calcium chloride, which absorbed and retained the oxidation product of the hydrogen of the sample, namely water vapor. Next, in the Kaliapparat, carbon dioxide was absorbed in a potassium hydroxide solution in the three lower bulbs, and used to measure the weight of carbon in the sample. For any substance consisting only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the percentage of oxygen was found by subtracting the carbon and hydrogen percentages from 100%; the remainder must be the percentage of oxygen. A charcoal furnace (a sheet-steel tray in which the combustion tube was laid) was used for the combustion. Weighing carbon and hydrogen directly, rather than estimating them volumetrically, greatly increased the method's accuracy of measurement. Liebig's assistant Carl Ettling perfected glass-blowing techniques for producing the Kaliapparat, and demonstrated them to visitors. Liebig's kaliapparat simplified the technique of quantitative organic analysis and rendered it routine. Brock suggests that the availability of a superior technical apparatus was one reason why Liebig was able to attract so many students to his laboratory. His method of combustion analysis was used pharmaceutically, and certainly made possible many contributions to organic, agricultural and biological chemistry.Three bulbs located along the bottom of the triangle hold the potassium hydroxide. Violent bubbling indicates that CO2 absorption is taking place, Rocke says. By the time the combustion gas has hit the third bulb, there should be little or no bubbling, a sign that all the CO2 has been absorbed, Rocke says. \u201cSo you can tell by eye if you\u2019ve done the experiment right.\u201dThere are two additional bulbs on the apparatus, one on the arm upstream of the triangle\u2019s base and another downstream. The upstream bubble can be used to test that there are no gas leaks in the system before starting the experiment. Before combustion, researchers suck potassium hydroxide into the upstream bubble, which should remain level if the system is airtight. The downstream bulb catches potassium hydroxide overflow, to ensure the solvent doesn\u2019t bubble out of the device.Perfection is, of course, hard to achieve: Rocke and colleagues found that Liebig\u2019s device provided \u201cerratic results for nitrogen.\u201d In fact, Jackson says, Liebig was \u201cunable to solve the extremely difficult problem of analyzing alkaloids such as morphine or quinine (which contain nitrogen) using the kaliapparat,\u201d Jackson says. She discovered that \u201cin response to this stalemate, Liebig prompted his student August Hofmann to introduce synthesis as a method for investigating organic chemistry\u2014a move that established the field of synthetic organic chemistry\u201d (Hist. Stud. Nat. Sci. 2012, DOI: 10.1525/hsns.2014.44.4.319).Yet \u201cthe success of the kaliapparat for the analysis of relatively simple compounds introduced and propagated a new practice of chemistry in hollow glassware,\u201d Jackson adds.\u201cThe image of a chemist, wearing a lab coat, in front of a bubbling glass apparatus goes back to the kaliapparat,\u201d says William Brock, an emeritus professor at England\u2019s University of Leicester and a Liebig biographer. \u201cIt became a symbol, like the periodic table, for what chemists do.\u201dThe most important quantitative tools of 19th century organic chemistry were the analytical balance and the Five-Bulb (F\u00fcnfkugel) Apparatus, usually called the \"Kaliapparat\" (interesting etymology), which Justus Liebig invented in 1831. These tools, together with well-chosen chemical transformations and clever reasoning, allowed 19th Century chemists to determine the nature of organic molecules and their reactions long before x-ray diffraction, structural spectroscopy, and chemical quantum mechanics were dreamt of.Liebig had an analytical balance (right), made by a local cabinet maker named Hoss, with which he could weigh 100 grams to an accuracy of 0.3 mg. If burning a half-gram sample produced something like a gram of CO2, he could weigh it to an accuracy of better than 0.1%.",

            "description": "Crookes tubes evolved from the earlier Geissler tubes invented by the German physicist and glassblower Heinrich Geissler in 1857, experimental tubes which are similar to modern neon tube lights. Geissler tubes had only a low vacuum, around 10\u22123 atm (100 Pa), and the electrons in them could only travel a short distance before hitting a gas molecule. So the current of electrons moved in a slow diffusion process, constantly colliding with gas molecules, never gaining much energy. These tubes did not create beams of cathode rays, only a colorful glow discharge that filled the tube as the electrons struck the gas molecules and excited them, producing light.By the 1870s, Crookes (among other researchers) was able to evacuate his tubes to a lower pressure, 10\u22126 to 5x10\u22128 atm, using an improved Sprengel mercury vacuum pump invented by his coworker Charles A. Gimingham. He found that as he pumped more air out of his tubes, a dark area in the glowing gas formed next to the cathode. As the pressure got lower, the dark area, now called the Faraday dark space or Crookes dark space, spread down the tube, until the inside of the tube was totally dark. However, the glass envelope of the tube began to glow at the anode end.What was happening was that as more air was pumped out of the tube, there were fewer gas molecules to obstruct the motion of the electrons from the cathode, so they could travel a longer distance, on average, before they struck one. By the time the inside of the tube became dark, they were able to travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, without a collision. They were accelerated to a high velocity by the electric field between the electrodes, both because they did not lose energy to collisions, and also because Crookes tubes were operated at a higher voltage. By the time they reached the anode end of the tube, they were going so fast that many flew past the anode and hit the glass wall. The electrons themselves were invisible, but when they hit the glass walls of the tube they excited the atoms in the glass, making them give off light or fluoresce, usually yellow-green. Later experimenters painted the back wall of Crookes tubes with fluorescent paint, to make the beams more visible.Johann Hittorf was first to recognise in 1869 that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadow.",

They discovered that applying pressure to crystals such as quartz, tourmaline and Rochelle salt generates electrical charges on the surface of these materials.Knowing that there exists a certain relation between crystal structure and pyroelectric behavior, which implies the existence of one or more polar axes, they applied pressure, not at random, as had been done already, first by Hauy and later by A. C. Becquerel, but in the direction of the so-called hemihedral azes of several pyroelectric crystals (zinc blende, sodium chlorate, boracite, tourmaline, quartz, calamine, topaz, tartaric acid, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt). Putting a properly cut crystal plate, provided with tin-foil electrodes, under pressure, they produced a charge, measured with an electrometer, that was proportional to the applied pressure. This is the direct, or generator effect of piezoelectricity. The converse effect, which deals with the motor property of piezoelectric crystals, consists in the deformation of the crystal that is directly proportional to the applied electric field. This effect was predicted by Lippmann in 1881 and was verified experimentally in the same year by the Curies. ",

Designs for glass contact lenses that fit in the eye, allowing the wearer to blink, were independently invented by three men: Dr. Adolf Fick, Eugene Cult, and Louis J. Girard. Credit for the discovery usually goes to Dr. Fick, a Swiss physician who wrote a treatise entitled \u201cA Contact Spectacle,\u201d in which he described the first contact lens with refractive power for visual improvement. The first physical example of the lens was made by artificial eye-maker F. A. Mueller in 1887. These types of contact lenses were called scleral lenses, and they covered the entire eye, not just the cornea. They were slightly convex, allowing room for tears or a dextrose solution\u2014the liquid that creates the refractive power to correct vision\u2014to fill the eye much like Da Vinci\u2019s bowl of water. In 1888, Dr. Fick constructed and fitted the first successful contact lens. However, there were two major issues with Fick\u2019s contacts: the lenses were made from heavy blown glass and were 18\u201321mm in diameter. The weight alone made them uncomfortable to wear, but worse, the glass lenses covered the entire exposed eye. Unlike other bodily organs, which are oxygenated by the blood, the eyes get their oxygen directly from the air. So covering your eyeballs with glass shields is, essentially, suffocating them. Scleral lens wearers experienced excruciating eye pain after a few hours of use. Nonetheless, glass scleral lenses were the main form of contact lenses for the next 60 years.",

He specifically postulated that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles. He called these units pangenes, a term 20 years later to be shortened to genes by Wilhelm Johannsen.To support his theory of pangenes, which was not widely noticed at the time, De Vries conducted a series of experiments hybridizing varieties of multiple plant species in the 1890s. Unaware of Mendel's work, De Vries used the laws of dominance and recessiveness, segregation, and independent assortment to explain the 3:1 ratio of phenotypes in the second generation. His observations also confirmed his hypothesis that the inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles.",

In 1886, he had discovered new forms among a display of the evening primrose (Oenothera lamarckiana) growing wild in an abandoned potato field near Hilversum, having escaped a nearby garden.[6] Taking seeds from these, he found that they produced many new varieties in his experimental gardens; he introduced the term mutations for these suddenly appearing variations. In his two-volume publication The Mutation Theory (1900\u20131903) he postulated that evolution, especially the origin of species, might occur more frequently with such large-scale changes than via Darwinian gradualism, basically suggesting a form of saltationism. De Vries's theory was one of the chief contenders for the explanation of how evolution worked, leading, for example, Thomas Hunt Morgan to study mutations in the fruit fly, until the modern evolutionary synthesis became the dominant model in the 1930s. During the early decades of the twentieth century, de Vries' theory was enormously influential and continued to fascinate non-biologists long after the scientific community had abandoned it.[7] The large-scale primrose variations turned out to be the result of various chromosomal abnormalities, including ring chromosomes, balanced lethals and chromosome duplications (polyploidy), while the term mutation now generally is restricted to discrete changes in the DNA sequence. However, the popular understanding of \"mutation\" as a sudden leap to a new species has remained a staple theme of science fiction, e.g. the X-Men movies (and the comic books that preceded them).",

Newton\u2019s theory depended on the assumption that mass, time, and distance are constant regardless of where you measure them.The theory of relativity treats time, space, and mass as fluid things, defined by an observer\u2019s frame of reference. All of us moving through the universe on the Earth are in a single frame of reference, but an astronaut in a fast-moving spaceship would be in a different reference frame.Within a single frame of reference, the laws of classical physics, including Newton\u2019s laws, hold true. But Newton\u2019s laws can\u2019t explain the differences in motion, mass, distance, and time that result when objects are observed from two very different frames of reference. To describe motion in these situations, scientists must rely on Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity.At slow speeds and at large scales, however, the differences in time, length, and mass predicted by relativity are small enough that they appear to be constant, and Newton\u2019s laws still work. In general, few things are moving at speeds fast enough for us to notice relativity. For large, slow-moving satellites, Newton\u2019s laws still define orbits. We can still use them to launch Earth-observing satellites and predict their motion. We can use them to reach the Moon, Mars, and other places beyond Earth. For this reason, many scientists see Einstein\u2019s laws of general and special relativity not as a replacement of Newton\u2019s laws of motion and universal gravitation, but as the full culmination of his idea.",

Finally, in 1909, a series of heritable mutants appeared, some of which displayed Mendelian inheritance patterns; in 1910 Morgan noticed a white-eyed mutant male among the red-eyed wild types. When white-eyed flies were bred with a red-eyed female, their progeny were all red-eyed. A second generation cross produced white-eyed males\u2014a sex-linked recessive trait, the gene for which Morgan named white. Morgan also discovered a pink-eyed mutant that showed a different pattern of inheritance. In a paper published in Science in 1911, he concluded that (1) some traits were sex-linked, (2) the trait was probably carried on one of the sex chromosomes, and (3) other genes were probably carried on specific chromosomes as well.",

The fungus had created bacteria-free zones wherever it grew on the plate. Fleming isolated and grew the mould in pure culture.

For the first time, it was possible to create contact lenses that conformed to the actual shape of the eye. And in the 1930\u2019s, new plastics made it possible to produce lightweight, transparent contact lenses. Unbreakable, scratch-resistant, malleable, and easy to manufacture plastic revolutionized the contact lens industry, making glass lenses quickly become obsolete. But even though the new lenses were plastic, they were still scleral lenses, covering the entire eye and only wearable for a few hours at a time.",
