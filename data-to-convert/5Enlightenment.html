The force of gravity is opposed by static friction and as the angle of tilt of the plane is increased, the brick will eventually start to move downwards as gravity overcomes the frictional resistance.</span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.2tgmy4k4nlpg"><span class="c3">Hot Air Engine (Amontons)</span></h2><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Guillaume Amontons is also the inventor of the hot air engine. In 1699 he built his first engine, more than a century earlier than the well-known Stirling engine. This engine, named by Amontons a &quot;fire mill&quot; (moulin &agrave; feu) followed a new thermodynamic cycle, which later became known as the Stirling cycle.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The fire mill is a wheel that makes use of the expansion of heated air to generate motive power. The calculated power of Amontons&#39; fire mill was 39 HP, equal to the power of the most powerful hot air engines of the 19th century (with the exception of the &quot;caloric engine&quot; of Ericsson). The main difference between Amontons&#39; engine and the hot air engines of the 19th century was the nature of the piston (Amontons used water) and the use of rotational motion instead of alternating motion.</span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.j1bcyl4fmxc"><span class="c1">1702</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.jjwyrbo2ucf1"><span class="c3">Air Pressure Thermometer (Amontons)</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Amontons established that the pressure of a gas increases by roughly one-third between the temperatures of cold and the boiling point of water. He devised a method of measuring a change in temperature in terms of a proportional change in pressure of a constant mass and volume of air. The relationship between the pressure and the temperature of a gas is therefore known as Amontons&#39; law.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">This was a substantial step towards the subsequent gas laws and, in particular, Gay-Lussac&#39;s law. His work led him to speculate that a sufficient reduction in temperature would lead to the disappearance of pressure. Though he came close to finding absolute zero - the theoretical temperature by which the volume of air in his air-thermometer will be reduced to nothing (estimated by him as &minus;240 on the Celsius scale), the discovery would not be complete until at least a century later.</span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.y1uzo7kncf5t"><span class="c3">Johann Joachim Becher</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">6 May 1635, Speyer, Holy Roman Empire (now Germany), October 1682, London, England</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_kdp25z9im1es-0 start"><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">Invented the phlogiston theory of combustion and rusting.</span></li></ul><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.ckwga75c2nuv"><span class="c3">Isaac Newton</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">December 25, 1642, Woolsthorpe Manor House, UK - March 31, 1727, Kensington, UK</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.kc8or0w8c7v0"><span class="c3">Georg Ernst Stahl</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">22 October 1659 Ansbach, Holy Roman Empire - 24 May 1734, Berlin, Holy Roman Empire</span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_kdp25z9im1es-0"><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">Popularized the phlogiston theory of combustion and rusting.</span></li></ul><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.4fo8mqaaxow9"><span class="c3">Guillaume Fran&ccedil;ois Rouelle</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">15 September 1703, Mathieu, France - 3 August 1770, Paris, France</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Teacher of Antoine Lavoisier.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_8sdfw1ql1xu6-0 start"><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">In 1754 he introduced the concept of a base into chemistry, as a substance which reacts with an acid to give it solid form (as a salt).</span></li></ul><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.ibu3wq1skcxn"><span class="c3">James Hutton</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">3 June 1726, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK - 26 March 1797, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Theory of rock formation.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.6e412a2rxjc"><span class="c3">James Cook</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Born 1728, Marton, Yorkshire, England - 14 February 1779, Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.cml6ltuly8q2"><span class="c1">1703</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.kn4x62eaqxon"><span class="c3">Tourmaline shipped from Ceylon to Holland.</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Pyroelectricity had been known in Europe since 1703 when crystals of tourmaline were shipped</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">from Ceylon to Holland.

George Hadley&#39;s version recognised that the Earth&#39;s rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass moving relative to the Earth, an element that had been missing in Halley&#39;s proposal. Later, in the second half of the 19th century, Hadley&#39;s theory was itself shown to be deficient in that it was based on an assumption that when air mass travels from one latitude to another its linear momentum is conserved. However, since the air mass is at all times in a state of circumnavigating the Earth axis, it is in fact the angular momentum that is conserved, causing an effect known as the Coriolis effect. When using the correct angular momentum conservation in calculations the predicted effect is twice as large as when the erroneous conservation of linear momentum is used.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.x6b5be8p4yo"><span class="c3">A Rational and Mechanical Essay on the Small Pox (Hillary)</span></h2><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.n7zlwrb3vraj"><span class="c3">Henry Cavendish</span></h2><ul class="c11 lst-kix_1ck2jd6u8kb8-0 start"><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">First calculation of Earth&#39;s mass (his results were just 10% off modern measurements).</span></li><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">He introduced the concept of voltage.</span></li></ul><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.j6577bgdo0vs"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Systema Naturae&rdquo; (Linnaeus)</span></h2><p class="c5 c6 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.4tqzszszg9ib"><span class="c1">1743</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.pn1ur3me9nls"><span class="c3">An Enquiry into the &hellip; Medicinal Virtues of Lincomb Spaw Water, near Bath (Hillary)</span></h2><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.ubakateocoiy"><span class="c3">An Account of the Life and Writings of Herman Boerhaave (Burton)</span></h2><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.r8m74q820baq"><span class="c1">1747</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.4o8g5w8ant3c"><span class="c3">Tourmaline effect is related to electricity (Linnaeus)</span></h2><h1 class="c2" id="h.z5utv66f8nxf"><span class="c1">1748</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.1ubx5xwwfo08"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&rdquo; (Euler)</span></h2><h1 class="c2" id="h.un5cbwn2bswa"><span class="c1">1750</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.w6jw0lfidgtu"><span class="c3">Analytical balance (Black)</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In about 1750, while still a student, Black developed the analytical balance based on a light-weight beam balanced on a wedge-shaped fulcrum.

As the microbes did not reappear as long as the material was hermetically sealed, he proposed that microbes move through the air and that they could be killed through boiling. Needham argued that experiments destroyed the &quot;vegetative force&quot; that was required for spontaneous generation to occur.

By 1777, Lavoisier was ready to propose a new theory of combustion that excluded phlogiston. Combustion, he said, was the reaction of a metal or an organic substance with that part of common air he termed &ldquo;eminently respirable.&rdquo; Two years later, he announced to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris that he found that most acids contained this eminently respirable air and, therefore, was calling it oxyg&egrave;ne, from the two Greek words for acid generator.</span></li><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">In June 1783, Lavoisier learned of the Cavendish experiment and immediately reacted oxygen with inflammable air, obtaining &ldquo;water in a very pure state.&rdquo; He correctly concluded that water was not an element but a compound of oxygen and inflammable air, or hydrogen as it is now known.

His hypothesis was that combustion and respiration were one and the same and combustion occurs with every instance of respiration. In 1784, with his friend Pierre-Simon Laplace, he designed an ingenious ice-calorimeter to measure the amount of emitted heat during combustion and respiration. This apparatus consisted of three chambers: the inside chamber held the source of heat, a live guinea pig or a piece of burning charcoal; the middle one held a specific amount of ice for the heat source to melt; and the outside chamber held packed snow for insulation. Moreover, they connected a sleeve in a separate container to collect the &lsquo;fixed air&rsquo; that was given off during combustion or respiration. They measured the quantifiable and specific amount of caloric and &lsquo;fixed air&rsquo; produced during respiration and concluded that respiration is combustion (la respiration est une combustion) that occurs in the lungs and enables the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.qe9wlovndaxa"><span class="c1">1786</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.8cdotwjkfyi0"><span class="c3">Fertilization is spermatozoa + ovum (Spallanzani)</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">His most important works were summed up in his book Experiencias Para Servir a La Historia de La Generaci&oacute;n De Animales y Plantas (Experiences to Serve to the History of the Generation of Animals and Plants), published in 1786.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Spallanzani described animal (mammal) reproduction in his Experiencias Para Servir a La Historia de La Generaci&oacute;n De Animales y Plantas (1786). He was the first to show that fertilisation requires both spermatozoa and an ovum. He was the first to perform in vitro fertilization, with frogs, and an artificial insemination, using a dog.[9] Spallanzani showed that some animals, especially newts, can regenerate some parts of their body if injured or surgically removed.[2]</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In spite of his scientific background, Spallanzani endorsed preformationism, an idea that organisms develop from their own miniature selves; e.g. animals from minute animals, animalcules. In 1784, he performed a filtration experiment in which he successfully separated seminal fluid of frogs &ndash; a liquid portion and a gelatinous animalcule (spermatozoa) portion. But then he assumed that it was the liquid part which could induce fertilisation. A staunch ovist, he believed that animal form was already developed in the eggs and fertilisation by semen was only an activation for growth.[10]</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.jp8pn0yuenss"><span class="c1">1788</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.32bwjyv8klmo"><span class="c3">Lagrangian mechanics</span></h2><h1 class="c2" id="h.dncotfdw8n3p"><span class="c1">1789</span></h1><h2 class="c4" id="h.xab95r8y23re"><span class="c3">Trait&eacute; &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire de chimie (Lavoisier)</span></h2><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Translation: &ldquo;Elements of Chemistry, in a New Systematic Order, Containing All the Modern Discoveries&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Read on:</span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_7qq9dj7crxdp-0 start"><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c14"><a class="c16" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30775/30775-h/30775-h.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1602013726606000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0t1Q-wpb_HFeVc7_4mOt3M">https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30775/30775-h/30775-h.htm</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">Apple Books - translation by Kerr</span></li></ul><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every branch of knowledge, that, in the progress of investigation, we should proceed from known facts to what is unknown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We must trust nothing but facts: These are presented to us by Nature, and cannot deceive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hence I have been obliged to depart from the usual order of courses of lectures and of treatises upon chemistry, which always assume the first principles of the science, as known, when the pupil or the reader should never be supposed to know them till they have been explained in subsequent lessons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&ldquo;Messrs </span><span class="c15">Geoffroy, Gellert, Bergman, Scheele, De Morveau, Kirwan</span><span class="c0">, and many others, have collected a number of particular facts upon this subject [chemical affinities], which only wait for a proper arrangement;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">`</span></p><p class="c5"><span>&ldquo;Perhaps a sentiment of self-love may, without my perceiving it, have given additional force to these reflections.
